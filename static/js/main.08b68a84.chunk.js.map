Intersectionality\n        should be taken into account when discussing feminism because it\n        includes all backgrounds and marginalized communities, understanding\n        that we all have different experiences. In “Sisterhood: Political\n        Solidarity Between Women” hooks explains that these concepts shouldn’t\n        be separated and have to be taken as a part of the same concern (hooks,\n        20). This means that feminism doesn’t need certain groups of women\n        caring for specific subjects (for example, not only black women should\n        fight racism, or not only poor women should dispute classism and social\n        structures). As a matter of fact, we need to understand that we have our\n        differences and fight together against the same concern. “Feminism as a\n        collective movement is made out of how we are moved to become feminists\n        in dialogue with others”, explains Ahmed in “Living a Feminist Life”.\n      </p>\n      <h3> Gender Identity: </h3>\n      <p>\n        {\" \"}\n        How a person identifies and defines themself. It is different from sex,\n        which refers to genitalia and is defined by the body, and different from\n        gender expression, which is how we choose to show ourselves to the\n        world. Gender is culturally and socially developed. Gender is often\n        policed and scrutinized when a person is “hard to read”, “too feminine”,\n        or “too masculine”. I would like to quote a suggestion from Dean Spades\n        on how to interact in an inclusive way with the trans and intersex\n        community. Spades suggest different ways to talk about bodies and\n        genitalia that are not referring to a specific gender. For example,\n        talking about menstruation or pregnancy, the correct use of inclusive\n        language would be “people who menstruate” or “people who are pregnant”\n        (“About Purportedly Gendered Body Parts”).{\" \"}\n      </p>\n      <h3> Women’s Representation in Media: </h3>\n      <p>\n        {\" \"}\n        Women are usually represented in media as stereotypically hegemonic,\n        heterosexual, skinny, often white, fragile, weak, etc. They are usually\n        represented as objects of men’s desires, and their chores are often\n        related to caring for the family and staying at home. If a woman does\n        not fit these specifications, then she's portrayed as too rebellious,\n        too promiscuous, etc. Heteronormative gender roles only contribute to\n        the false stereotype that we all have to do what our gender dictates.\n        This does not exist, it is not real, and it also perpetuates the idea\n        that women are objects and only serve for the entertainment of men, or\n        that men are the bosses of the house, and that they can unquestionably\n        pursue women regardless of their own desire. Robin Tran writes in “4\n        Ways Men Are Taught to Objectify Women From Birth” about how men have\n        internalized ways of thinking and objectifying women throughout their\n        lives, all thought through media. The four things that Robin highlights\n        are, first, that the media creates and perpetuates the idea that women\n        should be persecuted by men and that their opinions and ideas don't\n        count. He said: “In essence, women operated as empty vessels for men to\n        project their wants and needs onto” (Tran). Second, the perpetuation of\n        gender roles in school (beliefs like boys should not cry like girls).\n        The third is the damage of cis-normative language and the way of\n        assuming that all people are cisgender and heterosexual. And the last\n        one is that men are constantly instructed to think that women are their\n        property. All of this contributes to stereotyping and objectifying\n        women.{\" \"}\n      </p>\n      <h3> Disability Justice: </h3>\n      <p>\n        {\" \"}\n        A movement that centers “disabled people of color, immigrants with\n        disabilities, queers with disabilities, trans and gender non-conforming\n        people with disabilities, people with disabilities who are houseless,\n        people with disabilities who are incarcerated, people with disabilities\n        who have had their ancestral lands stolen, amongst others” (“Sick of\n        it!”). It is relatively a recent movement that was launched by three\n        disabled women of color. The disabled community maintains that their\n        bodies are not which makes them incapable, is the society that causes\n        the community to be oppressed. The concept of ableism is sustained as a\n        discriminatory control system, which is exercised to isolate disabled\n        people instead of uniting and incorporating them into society. Only the\n        individuals who serve the capitalist system are the chosen ones, the\n        rest are discarded.{\" \"}\n      </p>\n      <h3> Reproductive Justice: </h3>\n      <p>\n        {\" \"}\n        SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Health Collective, the biggest\n        national, multicultural, and multiracial movement for Reproductive\n        Justice, understands Reproductive Justice as “the human right to\n        maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and\n        parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities”\n        (“Reproductive Justice”). This means, having access to make personal\n        decisions about our bodies, though this doesn’t end in an individual\n        right but involves the whole community, including access to\n        comprehensive sex education, information, prevention and care related to\n        STIs, access to contraceptives and birth control, access to safe\n        abortion, prenatal and pregnancy care, respect of the rights to have\n        children, access to clean water and safe houses, and furthermore,\n        protection and assistance for gender violence or domestic violence. In\n        all these instances, starting from the choice to not have children to\n        the choice of being parents, RJ is intrinsic to the free decisions of\n        the gestating bodies. Moreover, it's not just about choices, explains\n        SisterSong, it's mainly about access.{\" \"}\n      </p>\n      <h3> Sexual Harassment and Gender Violence: </h3>\n      <p>\n        {\" \"}\n        There are two different forms of misogyny and abuse or violence toward\n        women, these are public and private. The private can be considered as\n        gender violence and is the one exercised by men with their girlfriends\n        or wives, they perceive that their masculinity is threatened and that\n        they must establish their dominance over women who are “out of their\n        control” (Arruzza et. al, 27). The other form of exercising misogyny can\n        be determined as public violence or sexual harassment, and it is\n        exercised by bosses in the workplace, in clinics by doctors, in the\n        streets by the police, by different people who are in power, and by\n        teachers in the classroom. This type of violence is perpetuated as an\n        instrument of exercising power over women, it is also institutional\n        violence, and the economy, race, and professionalism of women are at\n        stake.{\" \"}\n      </p>\n      <h3> Family: </h3>\n      <p>\n        {\" \"}\n        It is often associated with women, motherhood, and family, but this\n        stereotypical heterosexist concept about the binary of the genders and\n        the imposed gender roles is not accurate. Not every woman desires to be\n        a mother. In “Moral Dilemmas, Moral Strategies and the Transformation of\n        Gender”, Kathleen Gerson speaks of the social dilemma of the exercise of\n        these imposed gender roles in which women are responsible for taking\n        care of the family and their home, while men are responsible for\n        bringing money home and maintaining the family financially. She proposes\n        “Facing these dilemmas, young women and men must develop innovative\n        moral strategies to renegotiate work-family conflicts and transform\n        traditional views of gender, but persisting institutional obstacles\n        thwart their emerging aspirations to balance personal autonomy with\n        caring for others. To overcome these obstacles, we need to create more\n        humane, less gendered theoretical and social frameworks for\n        understanding and apportioning moral obligation.” These social\n        structures of what we expect from women can be related also to the media\n        representation and its perpetuation of gender roles.{\" \"}\n      </p>\n      <h3> Globalization: </h3>\n      <p>\n        {\" \"}\n        This is another concept that is related to feminism because to\n        understand intersectional feminism we must also take into account\n        capitalism, the economy, and the politics of the world. The concept of\n        globalization refers to the interconnection of all the economies of the\n        world, and it can be technological, political, cultural, or biological\n        as well. We must take into account that the media also put women at the\n        top of organizations and the military system as a gain for feminism when\n        this is all contrary. Dean Spade and Sarah Lazare write about\n        imperialism and the military-industrial complex: “The impacts of war —\n        such as reduction in basic services, electricity, and access to food and\n        water, loss of family members, and increased rates of illness and\n        disability — all increase women’s vulnerability to assault and worsen\n        the conditions of women’s labor” (“There’s Nothing Feminist About\n        Imperialism”).{\" \"}\n      </p>\n\n      <h1> Sources </h1>\n      <p>\n        {\" \"}\n        ☆ Ahmed, Sara. “Bringing Feminist Theory Home.” Living a Feminist Life,\n        Duke University Press, 2017{\" \"}\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        {\" \"}\n        ☆ Arruzza, Cinzia, Bhattacharya, Tithi and Fraser, Nancy.
