In \u201cSisterhood: Political Solidarity Between Women\u201d hooks explains that these concepts shouldn\u2019t be separated and have to be taken as a part of the same concern (hooks, 20).

I would like to quote a suggestion from Dean Spades on how to interact in an inclusive way with the trans and intersex community.

If a woman does not fit these specifications, then she's portrayed as too rebellious, too promiscuous, etc. Heteronormative gender roles only contribute to the false stereotype that we all have to do what our gender dictates. This does not exist, it is not real, and it also perpetuates the idea that women are objects and only serve for the entertainment of men, or that men are the bosses of the house, and that they can unquestionably pursue women regardless of their own desire. Robin Tran writes in \u201c4 Ways Men Are Taught to Objectify Women From Birth\u201d about how men have internalized ways of thinking and objectifying women throughout their lives, all thought through media. The four things that Robin highlights are, first, that the media creates and perpetuates the idea that women should be persecuted by men and that their opinions and ideas don't count. He said: \u201cIn essence, women operated as empty vessels for men to project their wants and needs onto\u201d (Tran). Second, the perpetuation of gender roles in school (beliefs like boys should not cry like girls). The third is the damage of cis-normative language and the way of assuming that all people are cisgender and heterosexual.

The other form of exercising misogyny can be determined as public violence or sexual harassment, and it is exercised by bosses in the workplace, in clinics by doctors, in the streets by the police, by different people who are in power, and by teachers in the classroom.

She proposes \u201cFacing these dilemmas, young women and men must develop innovative moral strategies to renegotiate work-family conflicts and transform traditional views of gender, but persisting institutional obstacles thwart their emerging aspirations to balance personal autonomy with caring for others.
